# SkinSim

This is the prototype of a web-based app that we designed for our BIOMENG 791 project, which involves askin surgery training tool based on a biomechanical finite-element model.

## Installation

To get this prototype up and running, simply clone and open `pages/index.html` in your browser (Chrome recommended).

## Usage

At the moment, this prototype is mostly a visual front-end proof of concept. An implementation of the simulation can be found on the `sim.html` page, accessible from the "Training" menu item in the sidebar.

The WebGL app allows the user to view a 2D deformation going from an open to closed state as the user omoves a slider. The 2D "skin block" is also able to be panned, rotated and zoomed using intuitive touch gestures.
